        { category: 'general', question: 'What is investment administration?', answer: 'Investment administration involves the day-to-day management of investment portfolios, including transaction processing, reconciliation, valuation, performance reporting, and tax reporting. It\'s the operational backbone that ensures your investments are accurately tracked and reported.' },
        { category: 'general', question: 'How is PortfolioGuardian different from other administrators?', answer: 'PortfolioGuardian stands out through our independence (we don\'t sell products or receive commissions), our fixed fee structure that doesn\'t increase with portfolio value, our ability to administer any asset on any platform, and our personalized service from qualified professionals.' },
        { category: 'services', question: 'What types of investments can you administer?', answer: 'We can administer virtually any type of investment, including listed securities (shares, ETFs), managed funds, fixed income investments, private equity, direct property, and alternative investments. Our systems are designed to handle diverse portfolio compositions.' },
        { category: 'services', question: 'Do you provide online access to portfolio information?', answer: 'Yes, we provide secure online access to your portfolio information through our client portal. This allows you to view your portfolio valuation, performance, transaction history, and reports at any time.' },
        { category: 'fees', question: 'How are your fees structured?', answer: 'We operate on a fixed fee basis, which means our fees are not linked to the value of your portfolio. This transparent approach ensures you know exactly what you\'re paying, and your costs don\'t automatically increase just because your investments perform well.' },
        { category: 'fees', question: 'Are there any hidden costs or additional charges?', answer: 'No, we believe in complete transparency. Our fee structure is clearly outlined from the beginning, with no hidden costs or surprise charges. Any additional services beyond our standard offering would be discussed and agreed upon before implementation.' },
        { category: 'paf', question: 'What are PAFs and PuAFs?', answer: 'Private Ancillary Funds (PAFs) and Public Ancillary Funds (PuAFs) are philanthropic structures that allow for tax-effective giving. PAFs are typically established by individuals or families, while PuAFs can receive donations from the public. Both structures require careful administration to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.' },
        { category: 'paf', question: 'What are the compliance requirements for PAFs?', answer: 'PAFs must distribute a minimum of 5% of the fund\'s net assets annually, maintain proper financial records, prepare annual financial statements, submit annual returns to the ATO, and comply with investment strategy requirements. Our administration services ensure all these requirements are met.' },
        { category: 'reporting', question: 'How frequently will I receive reports?', answer: 'We provide regular reporting based on your needs, including monthly, quarterly, and annual reports. These can be customized to focus on the aspects of your portfolio that matter most to you.' },
        { category: 'reporting', question: 'What information is included in your tax reports?', answer: 'Our comprehensive tax reports include a detailed breakdown of all income (dividends, interest, distributions), capital gains/losses with consideration of tax parcel selection methods, tax credits (including franking credits and foreign tax paid), and deductible expenses. These reports are designed to make tax time easier for both you and your accountant.' }
